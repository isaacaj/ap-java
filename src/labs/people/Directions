A person has a first and last name, an age, and a unique ID.
Make all of these variables private.
Now using eclipse, create getters and setters for all variables,
except ID, that should only have a getter. Why?

Create constructors for a default person, and a person who
knows their name, and age at creation.

Create a toString so the person is printed in a neat, formatted way.

Check to see if a person is unique.

Create a method that ages the person one year.

Create a person a, with your name, age.
print out a
age a another year
change a's name to be your neighbor
print out a
create another person b, with some name, age.
check to see if a and b are equal
